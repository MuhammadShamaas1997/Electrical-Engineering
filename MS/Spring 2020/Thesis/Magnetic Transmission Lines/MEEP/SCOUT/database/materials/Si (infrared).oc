Model adjusted to reflectance and transmittance measurements (done by J.Sturm) on a silicon wafer polished on both sides. Uses weak Brendel oscillators for multiphonon contributions and Si-O and Si-C vibrational modes. Discussion in W.Theiﬂ, habilitation thesis, RWTH Aachen 1995.
Attention: the Si-O and Si-C contributions may vary from wafer to wafer depending on preparation.
